# Homework 7 - Graphical user Interface Improvement
## Due date: April 26 2020 at 11:59 p.m.  

## This assignment will help students familiarize with Java Swing framework

Pull latest updates to https://git.txstate.edu/cs3354-256-spr20/ProgrammingProjects.git.
Copy hw7 folder to the folder of the repository corresponding to your NetID. Calculator.java implements a calculator functionality using swing. Compile and run the code.

1. 40 pt Change Calculator.java by implementing ActionListeners in a different way than provided.
 * Approach 1: create one or more ButtonListener classes that implements ActionListener and based on what is selected define action.
 * Approach 2: define separate anonymous class when each ActionListener is needed - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/anonymousclasses.html

 Four examples in lecture15/buttons provide four different implementation approaches.  Pick one approach and edit Calculator.java accordingly.  There will be no credit if the implementation is left as is.

2.  30 pt Extend the functionality of edited Calculator.java: add 1/x, x^2 (x square), and sqrt(x) (square root of x) buttons and implement these three functionalities so they are interactive like existing ones.

3. 20 pt  Change the button layout and size of the calculator so the functionality addition of 3 buttons looks native and more compact. Can you re-factor the methods in Calculator.java so they make more compact logical units?

4. 10 pt Add javadoc to Calculator.java.

There is no single correct solution.   If you are unsure about certain decisions and need to make assumptions, please state your assumptions clearly in your solution document.  

Submission: This homework can be done either individually or with a partner. If you are working with a partner, BOTH need to submit a version to respective class repositories - specify both names in the submitted java file under @author tag

•	Submission folder git.txstate.edu/cs3354-256-spr20/YourNetID/src/main/java/ -> you will add edited hw7 folder and push to git server.

•	Submission files need to have timestamps before due date.
